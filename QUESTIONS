1) Fill in the table below to indicate the average speedup for various
sizes of the thread pool. Because the results will vary significantly
from run to run, use the option -g 20 to run the boggle code
20 times to get a better average.

thread pool size    average speedup
       4              
       8             
      12            
      16           
      20          
      24         

2) You should see the average speedup increases when the thread pool
size increases up to the size 20.  Why don't we see a speedup for 
thread pool sizes 20 and 24.


3) Note that when the number of threads increases, there is also increased
competition to update the solution vector.  How might an
increase in the number of solution words impact performance?
